# Counting things - What kind of insight does it provide us?

"Couting what potatoes?" that's a phrase you must have probably already on a math class.  
Since the dawn of humanity, the human being felt the necessity to classify things and count them.  
However, 

Say for example you have to count the number of red fruits on a table.

red apples / green apples
are peaches red?
categorizing berries as whole
Unripe balckberry

Why classifying apples as whole but not raspberries?
Are vegetables fruits?
Weight / cost

## Github LOC

- **Documentation** - being automatically generated (*e.g.* `HTML`, or handwritten, *e.g.* `Latex`)
- **Verbosity** - different number of SLOC for two more programs with the same purpose (*e.g.* "Hello World" in `C` vs
  `Python`)
- **Separate languages** - separate language classification for same extensions (*e.g.* `PHP` and `Blade` are classified
  separately)
- **Exclusion** - Not being classified at all as a language (*e.g.* `JSON` and `Markdown`)
- Jupyter Notebook (many lines of code are automaticall generated)
- **One-liners** (`Haskell`)
- **Misclassification** - `ROFF`/`CHIP-8`
  
Why is Latex considered a language, but not, let's say Markdown? To achieve the same purpose.  
Or Jupyter Notebook being just a glorified JSON that wraps Python code?  
Heck, JSON can even be classified as valid Javascript code.  
Blade is a separate language, but not Python Django code.

Some of these concerns can be mitigated with a correct configuration of `.gitattributes`, however this needs a correct
knowledge of the source code.
