            <h2>Catching all Pokemon - An OCD Quest</h2>

            <h3>Preface</h3>
            <p>
                Writing this is already triggering my OCD. <br>
                The font I use doesn't support accents, so I can't write "Pok√©mon" the right way (yes, <a href="https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/336890/why-is-pok%C3%A9mon-written-with-an-accent">it has an accent</a>), without the "e" being of another font.
            </p>

            <h3>Story time</h3>
            <p>
                Who has never played pokemon? Well, I don't know, but bless them, because if you did and you tried to honor the series' motto - <i>Gotta catch'em all</i> - you probably have crippling depression by now <del>like me</del>.
            </p>

            <p>
                I can't tell you how much of a pain in the ass üçë this is, no wonder why the bastards who develop these games are <del>game</del><i>freaks.</i>

            <p>It all started in primary school.</p>
            <p>
                The first generation remakes had just come out, but no one had a Gameboy Advance, so we would play it on our <i>Magalh√£es</i> in emulators (with all sort of cheats).<br>

                It was fun, nobody would reach the end game tho, because they wouldn't understand english.
                Me, however, wanted to finish a pok√©mon game, catch all the legendaries, heck, have a game cartridge at least. So, I went ahead and I bought Pok√©mon Heartgold.<br>
                Oh boy... I literally just wanted to play a pok√©mon game from begin to end and I chose the one who has double the gyms of all the other games.
            </p>

            <p>No wonder it took me a <i>decade</i> to finish the game... Yeah, I bought in its release in 2009 and only finished it last year...</p>

                You can check my current progress below. I hope it's already in 100% when you get to see it.<br>
                If it isn't then well, you can always help me achieving it.
