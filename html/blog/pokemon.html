            <h2>Catching all Pokemon - An OCD Quest</h2>

            <h3>Preface</h3>
            <p>
                Writing this is already triggering my OCD. <br>
                The font I use doesn't support accents, so I can't write "Pok√©mon" the right way (yes, <a href="https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/336890/why-is-pok%C3%A9mon-written-with-an-accent">it has an accent</a>), without the "e" being of another font.
            </p>

            <h3></h3>
            <p>Who has never played pokemon? Well, I don't know, but bless them, because if you did and you tried to honor the series' motto - <i>Gotta catch'em all</i> - you probably have crippling depression by now.</p>

            <p>I can't tell you how much of a pin in the ass this is, no wonder why the bastards who develop these games are <del>game</del><i>freaks</i></p>
