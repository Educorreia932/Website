            <h2>Website Creation - How this came to be</h2>

            <h3>The Origins</h3>

            <p>It all began on the summer of '85 in Irkutsk, Russia.</p>
            <p>I was travessing the syberian wilderness when I got suddenly ambushed by a pack of wolves.</p>

                <figcaption>A photo of the <del>fuckers</del> cute creatures I took before they tried to kill me</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p>My whole life flashed trough my eyes, when a old man came to save me.</p>
            <p>He cured my wounds with some shaman enchantments and to thank him, I paid him 5 BTC (they didn't worth much at the time).</p>

                <figcaption>Me paying the shaman for his kind services. <br> I said he was an old man, but I almost died at that moment, so my senses arranged a nicer sight for me to see before I went (✖╭╮✖)</figcaption>

            <p>That's when it all clicked. I was on Syberia, the perfect place to build a bitcoin mining central, afterall the cooling was already there lul.</p>
            <p>But I couldn't let anyone know of this, so that's why this site exists, to cover my <del>illegal shoe factory in Malasya runned by chinese slaves</del> intents of dominating the cryptocurrency market.</p>

            <h3>First Attempt</h3>

            <p>Still inexperienced, I developed the first version of this Website and hosted in Github Pages (I couldn't afford a server after spending all my internet money with the old man).</p>
            <p>It looked like this:</p>
